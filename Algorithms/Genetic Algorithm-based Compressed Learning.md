This figure details the steps for the genetic algorithm for learning a binary mask. The binary mask is then applied to the original image as a  [[Compressive Sensing |CS]] framework.

Applying GACL to learn the mask improves the [[Structural Similarity Index | SSIM ]] metric which implies the image is more legible even at low MR or $P\%$ / pixels selected.
